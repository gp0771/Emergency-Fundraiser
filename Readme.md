# Emergency Fundraiser

The **Emergency Fundraiser** is a decentralized platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to donate ETH to an emergency fundraiser, track the amount raised, and enables the fundraiser owner to withdraw the funds once the goal is met and the deadline has passed.

This project is implemented using Solidity smart contracts and Web3.js for frontend interactions.

## Features

- **Donate**: Users can donate ETH to the fundraiser before the deadline.
- **Track Progress**: View the current amount raised, the funding goal, and the time left before the deadline.
- **Owner Actions**: The fundraiser owner can withdraw the funds once the goal is met and the deadline has passed.
- **Deadline Handling**: Fundraising stops automatically once the deadline is reached.
- **Goal Tracking**: The goal is marked as met once the total raised amount is equal to or greater than the goal.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum**: Decentralized blockchain for managing donations and fundraiser data.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract language for implementing the Emergency Fundraiser logic.
- **Web3.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet extension for user authentication and transaction management in the browser.

## Prerequisites

Before using the application, ensure you have the following:

- **MetaMask** browser extension installed.
- **Ethereum account** connected via MetaMask (you can use a testnet or the mainnet).
- **Deployed Smart Contract**: You need to deploy the `EmergencyFundraiser` smart contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., Goerli, Rinkeby, or the Ethereum mainnet).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency-fundraiser.git
cd emergency-fundraiser
```
````

### 2. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the `EmergencyFundraiser` contract, follow these steps:

- Compile and deploy the contract using an Ethereum development framework like [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/), or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).
- Once deployed, note down the contract address and ABI.

### 3. Update the Frontend with Contract Details

In the `index.html` file, replace the following placeholders with the deployed contract's details:

- **Contract Address**: Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the actual contract address.
- **Contract ABI**: You can obtain the ABI from Remix or your development framework, and replace the ABI section in the `index.html`.

```javascript
const contractAddress = "YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"; // Replace with your contract address
const contractABI = [ ... ]; // Replace with your contract ABI
```

### 4. Open the Application

After updating the contract details, open the `index.html` file in your browser. Ensure that you have MetaMask installed and connected to the correct Ethereum network.

### 5. Interact with the Platform

- **Connect MetaMask**: Click "Connect MetaMask" to link your Ethereum account.
- **Donate to Fundraiser**: Enter the donation amount and click "Donate" to contribute ETH to the fundraiser.
- **View Fundraiser Progress**: The platform shows the current goal, total raised amount, and deadline.
- **Withdraw Funds (Owner Only)**: Once the goal is met and the deadline has passed, the fundraiser owner can withdraw the funds by clicking "Withdraw Funds".

## Smart Contract Functions

The smart contract defines the following functions:

### `donate()`

- Allows users to donate ETH to the fundraiser.
- Donations are accepted only if the deadline has not passed.

### `withdrawFunds()`

- Allows the fundraiser owner to withdraw the funds once the goal is met and the deadline has passed.
- This function can only be called by the fundraiser owner and ensures that funds are not withdrawn more than once.

### `goalAmount()`

- Returns the funding goal for the fundraiser.

### `totalRaised()`

- Returns the total amount raised for the fundraiser.

### `deadline()`

- Returns the deadline timestamp for the fundraiser.

### `goalMet()`

- Returns a boolean indicating whether the funding goal has been met.

### `fundsWithdrawn()`

- Returns a boolean indicating whether the funds have already been withdrawn.

### Key Sections of the README:

1. **Features**: Describes the core functionality of the Emergency Fundraiser platform.
2. **Technologies Used**: Lists the technologies used, including Ethereum, Solidity, Web3.js, and MetaMask.
3. **Prerequisites**: Details the tools and software needed to use the platform.
4. **Setup Instructions**: Explains how to clone, deploy the contract, and set up the frontend.
5. **Smart Contract Functions**: Provides an overview of the key functions in the smart contract.
6. **License**: Specifies the license for the project (MIT).
7. **Disclaimer**: Warns users to test the contract before using it on the mainnet and to be mindful of transaction fees.

### Next Steps:
- Replace `YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` and the ABI in the `index.html` file with your actual contract details.
- Deploy the contract on a testnet (e.g., Goerli) for testing, and then use it on the mainnet if everything works as expected.
